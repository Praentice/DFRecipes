Regarding the configuration of your forensic workstation, you have two choices. The first one is using an existant distro tuned from Vanilla Debian, Ubuntu OS or create your own distro from scratch. Please consult the right section based on your needs. Using an existant distro Using an existant distro can be very useful if you want to setup a forensic workstation as a VM. You can find on the following table, the existing distro for the forensic world. Name Description OS Link Tsuguri Forensic distro which includes popular forensic and OSINT tools.

Both ways are fine with this OS REDACTED Discontinued Paladin, GRML are distro which are best run as a live session whereas Renmux, Tsuguri is best run as an installed OS. CAINE and DEFT Zero are fine in either way. Please note that all of these OS have built-in write blocking protection for any storage media plugged on the computer. Each distro have their pros and cons, personally, I setup a forensic workstation on a Raspberry PI and virtual forensic workstation, using the Tsuguri distro on my own personnal laptop for Forensic CTF. Setting your workstation from scratch Step N\u00b0 1 : Choose the right distro The first step is to choose the right linux distro. The key here is to choose a Linux OS you're comfortable with. If you have no idea of which one to use, you can try Debian, Ubuntu or Slackware Step N\u00b0 2 : Install the distro Step N\u00b0 3 : Configuring your workstation To avoid unwanted actions on digital evidence such as storage media, we want to make sure that any storage media plugged to our workstation will be marked as \"Read-only\". Even though a storage media can have the flag \"Read-only\", it will be still possible for the linux kernel to do write I/O on the storage media. To avoid this issue, you have two ways : Buy/Install a hardware write blocker These device are placed between the workstation and the evidence you want to analyze. Their primary goal is to block any attempt from the workstation to realize write operation on the evidence. The massive cons of this technology is that it can be very expensive to buy one of this devices for the benefits. Buy/Install a software write blocker A software write blocker works in the same fashion as a hardware write blocker except that it is a software which is running on your workstation. It can be a third parties software or a even a patch on the Linux kernel. As long as the software configuration is correctly done, its reliability will be the same as an hardware write blocker. How to patch and recompile our own linux kernel In this section, I'm going to explain how to patch your own kernel to \"truly\" mark a storage-media as \"Read-only\" and avoid unwanted write I/O on digital evidences. The first step you need to do is to open a terminal and type this command : uname -r Based on the output, please refer to the tailored section to your needs to configure your kernel. Version superior to 3.15.1, 4.14, 5.4 First, you need to install the following packages : Debian, Ubuntu sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install Once it's done, go to /usr/src to find the kernel source. You will need to find the kernel version you want to install. Consult this link to download the right kernel https://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ Then, download the kernel file on your PC : wget https://link/to/kernel/file.com #Download the kernel wget https://link/to/kernel/signature.com #Download the kernel signature Uncompress the archive and check the signature tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz | gpg --verify linux-5.10.62.tar.sign - #If archive is a tar.gz file unxz -c linux-5.10.62.tar.xz | gpg --verify linux-5.10.62.tar.sign - #If archive is a tar.xz file Once you have the archive, launch the following command cp /boot/config-5.10.0-8-amd64 ~/kernel/linux-source-5.10/.config #Keep the new configuration as close as possible to the previous kernel version Before we go compile the kernel, we need to several files to activate the write blocking ability of the kernel. any_text_editor_software ~/kernel/config-version/block/blk-core.c Go to the line N\u00b0 708 or to the function bio_check_ro(struct bio *bio, struct hd_struct *part) and change this line : return false to return true Once it's done, you can save and close the file. Now that we have patched the source code of the downloaded kernel, we can begin to compile the kernel. Please consult the \"Credits\" section if you want to have additionnal informations regarding this patch from Maxim Suhanov. Step N\u00b0 4 : Install the needed packages Now that we have the right foundation to create our forensic workstation, we need to downloads the software which will be needed for forensic purposes. Step N\u00b0 5 : Post-installation If you have successfully accomplished all the previous steps, then congralutations ! Enjoy your tuned workstation and don't forget to create a snapshot if it is a virtual machine. This will allow you to go back to a functionnal version of your VM in case you have broken it.
