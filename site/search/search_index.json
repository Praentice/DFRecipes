Skip to the \"Ready-to-use regex\" if you're looking for useful regex. Charsets Here's some examples to understand charsets : Basic [abc] : Match every occurences of a, b and c. [a-c] : The same as above [a-cx-z] : Match every occurences of a, b, c, x, y and z. [a-zA-Z] : Match any single lowercase or uppercase letter [^k] : Match any single letter except the letter k which is excluded from the charset Advanced Once you understood complety the Basic part of charset, we can now go through advanced examples of using charset : - [cfh]at : Match the words cat, fat, hat but not bat for example - [Ff]ile[1-9] : Match the words File1, File2, file3, file4, file5, File7, file9 - [Ff]ile[^7] : Same as above except that it doesn't match the word File7 I hope these examples helped you to understand how the charset capabilities can be combined to create regex rules. Wildcards and optional characters a.c : Match for example aac, abc, a0c, a$c and so on. Please note here that the . dot is a wildcard which allows us to match any single characters except the line break. abc? : Match for example ab, abc. When using the ? question mark, any single character which precede it will be marked as optionnal. \\ : This special character can be used to escape any specials characters such as . , ? ... For example, the regex cat\\.xyz will only match the string cat.xyz and not cataxyz, catbxyz and so on. Metacharacters and repetitions Even though charset are useful when it comes to creating regex/ Metacharacters \\d matches a digit, like 9 \\D matches a non-digit, like A or @ \\w matches an alphanumeric character, like a or 3 \\W matches a non-alphanumeric character, like ! or # \\s matches a whitespace character (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) \\S matches everything else (alphanumeric characters and symbols) Repetitions {12} - exactly 12 times. {1,5} - 1 to 5 times. {2,} - 2 or more times. * - 0 or more times. + - 1 or more times. For example, look at these regex : cats{4} : Match the string catssss [Cc]ats* : Match the words Cat, cats, catsss regex go br+ : Match the sentences regex go br, regex go brrrrrr and so on Starts with/ ends with, groups, and either/ or Sometimes it's very useful to specify that we want to search by a certain pattern in the beginning or the end of a line . We do that with these characters: ^ - starts with $ - ends with So for example, if you want to search for a line that starts with abc , you can use ^abc . If you want to search for a line that ends with xyz , you can use xyz$ . Note: The ^ hat symbol is used to exclude a charset when enclosed in [ square brackets ] , but when it is not, it is used to specify the beginning of a word. You can also define groups by enclosing a pattern in ( parentheses ) . This function can be used for many ways that are not in the scope of this tutorial. We will use it to define an either/ or pattern, and also to repeat patterns. To say \"or\" in Regex, we use the | pipe. For an \"either/or\" pattern example, the pattern during the (day|night) will match both of these sentences: during the day and during the night . For a repetition example, the pattern (no){5} will match the sentence nonononono .

What is the windows registry ? The Windows Registry is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data. This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information. It also includes data about the recently used files, programs used, or devices connected to the system. As you can understand, this data is beneficial from a forensics standpoint. Throughout this room, we will learn ways to read this data to identify the required information about the system. You can view the registry using regedit.exe, a built-in Windows utility to view and edit the registry. We'll explore other tools to learn about the registry in the upcoming tasks. The Windows registry consists of Keys and Values. When you open the regedit.exe utility to view the registry, the folders you see are Registry Keys. Registry Values are the data stored in these Registry Keys. A Registry Hive is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk. The registry on any Windows system contains the following five root keys: Folder / Predefined key Description HKEY_CURRENT_USER Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU. HKEY_USERS Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS. HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software . The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR. Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes key has settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user. The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. To change the default settings, changes must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes . If you write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes . If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes , the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes . HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.

You should search for the following file Name Description Path hiberfil.sys Hibernation File generated by the Windows OS to speed up the boot process %SystemDrive%/hiberfil.sys Virtual machine In case you have to lead investigations on a virtual machine, you simply need to copy these file without having to interact with the virtual machine : Name Description Link VMware - .vmem file Hyper-V - .bin file Parallels - .mem file VirtualBox - .sav file For this type of hypervisor, you will need to dump the memory like a normal bare-metal system Investigation Volatility2 Identify the OS system Before starting the investigation, you will need to determine the OS used on the machine. So, you need to run one of the following commands volatility -f file.dmp imageinfo volatility -f file.dmp kdbgscan Once you have identified the OS used on the machine, save the found profile nearby, you're going to need it for the rest of your investigation when running volatility commands.

This page will help you configure your computer to get the following functionalities for your host and virtual machines : Local website which hosts severals services and resources such as Cyberchef, PDF documents... Local FTP server which allow you to easily transfer files between virtual machines Installation First, update your system with these commands : sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade # For ubuntu and debian sudo pacman -Syu # For arch based system Then, install the following softwares on your pc : sudo apt install vsftpd nginx dnsmasq #Ubuntu and Debian system yay -S vsftpd nginx dnsmasq #For arch based systems sudo pacman -S vsftd nginx dnsmasq #Alternative for arch based system Now that you have installed the required software, we can now configure them Configuration DNSmasq The aim of this section is to configure the DNS server so you can access your own offline lab without using an IP address. The first step is to get the IP address of the host machine. Use the following command and spot the virtual network interface : ifconfig #First command ip addr show #Second command Note the IP address you found, you will use it later. Now that we have our own IP address, we can configure the dnsmasq service. Open the configuration file /etc/dnsmasq.conf and add the following line to the end : bind-interfaces # Put here the DNS server of your choice server=1.1.1.1 log-queries # does not go upstream to resolve addresses ending in 'your-domain.lab' local=/your-domain.lab/ Then change the configuration of the file /etc/resolv.conf to use dnsmasq to resolve address by changing this line : nameserver 127.0.0.1 And don't forget to add your domain name in the /etc/hosts file : your_libvirt_ip_address your_domain.lab You should now be able to access your own local lab by using the domain name you choose. WEB server Home page The first step we're going to do is to configure the WEB server so it can host our services. The default public location of nginx is /usr/share/nginx/html . You can use the following source code to replace the default file index.html : <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Home lab</title> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"style.css\"> </head> <body> <h1>Welcome !</h1> <p>Choose the service you want to access</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\">Resources link</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://localhost/\">Home</a></td> <td>Repertoire de base</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://localhost/\">Resource N\u00b0 1</a></td> <td>Lorem Ipsum</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://localhost/\">Resource N\u00b0 2</a></td> <td>Lorem Ipsum </td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"http://localhost/\">Resource N\u00b0 2</a></td> <td>Lorem Ipsum</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br> <p><em>Created by YOUR_NAME, local usage only.</em></p> </body> </html> Feel free to add rows to the table to add your own resources. Enable directory listing To enable directory listing in nginx, you need to configure the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and add these lines within the 'server' location. location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html; index index.html index.htm; } Don't forget to restart nginx with this command : sudo systemctl restart nginx And you should be able to brose the directory within the web server. Add services Now that your web server is configured, you can add the services of your choice. Personally, I choose to install cyberchef on my own lab. Cyberchef To install Cyberchef on your local web server, create a new directory called cyberchef in /usr/share/nginx/html . Once it's done, you can download the latest release of cyberchef and unzip the file content within the cyberchef directory. Don't forget to rename the html file to index.html and you should be able to use cyberchef on your own PC offline through the web server. Add whatever you want From now on, you should have a fully functionnal web server. Based on your needs and occupations, why not install on the web server, services you think are essential to you ? The choice is yours ! FTP server The aim of this section is to help you deploy a FTP server to easily transfer files between your virtual and host machine. Locate the root folder of your service The first step is to locate the folder of the FTP server. In my case, it is /var/ftp/pub . Create an user for the FTPuser sudo useradd -md /var/ftp/pub ftpuser #Create a user called ftpuser and set its home directory in /var/ftp/pub sudo passwd ftpuser #Add a password to the account sudo mkdir /var/ftp/pub/home #Create a folder called home in the path /var/ftp/pub Now that the user is created, we can now configure the FTP server : Configure the vsftpd service Locate and modify the file /etc/vsftpd.conf . Make sure that the following lines are configured in the same fashion on your side : #Disable anonymous login anonymous_enable=NO #Allow local user to connect to the servers local_enable=YES # Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command. write_enable=YES #Enable writing in the folders # Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they # go into a certain directory. #messages given to remote users when they go into a certain directory. dirmessage_enable=YES # Activate logging of uploads/downloads. xferlog_enable=YES # Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data). connect_from_port_20=YES # Add a banner when a user connects on the FTP server: banner_file=/var/ftp/banner #Force local user to stay within the folder they connected in chroot_local_user=YES # Listen for IPv4 sockets listen=YES # Set own PAM service name to detect authentication settings specified # for vsftpd by the system package. pam_service_name=vsftpd # Make sure that the folder designated in 'local_root' directive is not writable local_root=/var/ftp/pub #Minimum port for creating passive connections pasv_min_port=40000 #Maximum port for creating passive connections pasv_max_port=50000 # Create a whitelist of users which can access the ftp server userlist_enable=YES #Don't forget to create the file mentionned in the directive 'userlist_file' #and to add the user created earlier in it ! userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist userlist_deny=NO #Disable SELinux for vsftpd to avoid bugs seccomp_sandbox=NO # Permissions applicated to any files and folder uploaded on the server. file_open_mode=0777 # Remove executions rights from the uploaded folders and files local_umask=0011 Create the banner Use the following commands to create the banner which will be used by the server sudo touch /var/ftp/banner sudo nano /var/ftp/banner #Write whatever you want in this file Create the userlist Use the following commands to create the userlist which will be used by the server sudo touch /etc/vsftpd.userlist echo /etc/vsftpd.userlist Configure the permissions sudo chown ftpuser:ftpuser -R /var/ftp/pub/home sudo chmod 777 -R /var/ftp/pub/home sudo chmod 555 /var/ftp/pub #Disable write access for anyone in the path /var/ftp/pub Launching the service sudo systemctl enable vsftpd #Allow the service vsftp to start on the machine startup sudo systemctl disable vsftpd #Allow the service vsftp to start on the machine startup sudo systemctl restart vsftpd #Restart the vsftpd service after you change its configuration If everything went well, you should have access to a fully functional FTP service on which you can upload anything you want ! Accessing your local FTP server Personnaly, I decided to use the FTP client called Filezilla . It is free, under GNU/GPL license and can be installed on any platforms such as Windows, Linux... Just download the software from the official website, install it on your virtual machines and you're good to go ! Firewall Configuration of the firewall Before you can access your services, make sure that the firewall installed on your PC allows any connections from the virtual machines to your host machine. You just need to open the ports 80,20,21 and the range 40000-50000 on your host machine and you should be fine. Troubleshooting Network I can't access any of my services ! Please verify the following points : - Make sure that the service you want to access is running - Make sure that the firewall doesn't block incoming and outgoing connections on the host machine - Make sure that the firewall configuration is persistent, even after the restart of the host machine FTP server I don't have access to the uploaded files and folder from my host machine with my main account ! Run this command to add your main account in the same group as the user used for the ftp server : sudo usermod -a -G ftpuser $(whoami) From now on, you should have access to all files and folder which will be created in the path /var/ftp/pub/home directory.","title":"Local lab setup"},{"location":"Environment%20setup/Local%20lab%20setup/#local-lab-setup","text":"The aim of this page is to help you configure your own local forensic lab for forensic purposes.

Regarding the configuration of your forensic workstation, you have two choices. The first one is using an existant distro tuned from Vanilla Debian, Ubuntu OS or create your own distro from scratch. Please consult the right section based on your needs. Using an existant distro Using an existant distro can be very useful if you want to setup a forensic workstation as a VM. You can find on the following table, the existing distro for the forensic world. Linux Here is a list of distros based on Linux to meet forensic needs. Name Description OS Link Tsuguri Forensic distro which includes popular forensic and OSINT tools. Best run as an installed OS Based on Ubuntu Tsuguri-linux PALADIN Forensic distro which aims to provide tools for disk imaging and data viewer. Best run as a live session.

Base on Ubuntu Renmux Challenger OS Data recovery distro which aims to provide rescue tools to save data from disk. Best run as an installed OS. Based on slackware ChallengerOS DEFT Zero Forensic distro which aims to provide basic forensic tools like Autopsy, testdisk, photorec... Both ways are fine with this OS REDACTED Discontinued Trace Labs VM Kali Linux OS tuned to suit OSINT purposes Based on Kali Linux TRACE Labs VM Paladin, GRML are distro which are best run as a live session whereas Renmux, Tsuguri is best run as an installed OS. CAINE and DEFT Zero are fine in either way. Please note that all of these OS have built-in write blocking protection for any storage media plugged on the computer. Windows Here is a list of distros based on Windows to meet forensic needs. Name Description OS Link FLARE VM Reverse engineering distributions for windows malware analysis Based on Microsoft Windows FLARE VM Personally, I have this setup : A raspberry PI 3 with a modified kernel to clone hard drive for forensic purposes A laptop with the following virtual machines a VM with Parrot OS (Linux) installed for pentest and forensic purposes a VM with Flare VM (Windows) for the reverse engineering of windows malwares a VM with Flare VM (Windows) for forensic purposes a VM with Remnux install for the reverse engineering of linux malwares a VM with a distro from Trace Labs VM for OSINT purposes. Please keep in mind that the best setup you can have is the one which suit you the best. Don't hesitate to experiment several distros to see the ones you like the most. Setting your workstation from scratch Step N\u00b0 1 : Choose the right distro The first step is to choose the right linux distro. The key here is to choose a Linux OS you're comfortable with. If you have no idea of which one to use, you can try Debian, Ubuntu or Slackware Step N\u00b0 2 : Install the distro Step N\u00b0 3 : Configuring your workstation To avoid unwanted actions on digital evidence such as storage media, we want to make sure that any storage media plugged to our workstation will be marked as \"Read-only\". Even though a storage media can have the flag \"Read-only\", it will be still possible for the linux kernel to do write I/O on the storage media. To avoid this issue, you have two ways : Buy/Install a hardware write blocker These device are placed between the workstation and the evidence you want to analyze. Their primary goal is to block any attempt from the workstation to realize write operation on the evidence. The massive cons of this technology is that it can be very expensive to buy one of this devices for the benefits. Buy/Install a software write blocker A software write blocker works in the same fashion as a hardware write blocker except that it is a software which is running on your workstation. It can be a third parties software or a even a patch on the Linux kernel. As long as the software configuration is correctly done, its reliability will be the same as an hardware write blocker. How to patch and recompile our own linux kernel In this section, I'm going to explain how to patch your own kernel to \"truly\" mark a storage-media as \"Read-only\" and avoid unwanted write I/O on digital evidences. The first step you need to do is to open a terminal and type this command : uname -r Based on the output, please refer to the tailored section to your needs to configure your kernel. Version superior to 3.15.1, 4.14, 5.4 First, you need to install the following packages : Debian, Ubuntu sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install Once it's done, go to /usr/src to find the kernel source. You will need to find the kernel version you want to install. Consult this link to download the right kernel https://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ Then, download the kernel file on your PC : wget https://link/to/kernel/file.com #Download the kernel wget https://link/to/kernel/signature.com #Download the kernel signature Uncompress the archive and check the signature tar -xvzf archive.tar.gz | gpg --verify linux-5.10.62.tar.sign - #If archive is a tar.gz file unxz -c linux-5.10.62.tar.xz | gpg --verify linux-5.10.62.tar.sign - #If archive is a tar.xz file Once you have the archive, launch the following command cp /boot/config-5.10.0-8-amd64 ~/kernel/linux-source-5.10/.config #Keep the new configuration as close as possible to the previous kernel version Before we go compile the kernel, we need to several files to activate the write blocking ability of the kernel. any_text_editor_software ~/kernel/config-version/block/blk-core.c Go to the line N\u00b0 708 or to the function bio_check_ro(struct bio *bio, struct hd_struct *part) and change this line : return false to return true Once it's done, you can save and close the file. Now that we have patched the source code of the downloaded kernel, we can begin to compile the kernel. Please consult the \"Credits\" section if you want to have additionnal informations regarding this patch from Maxim Suhanov. Step N\u00b0 4 : Install the needed packages Now that we have the right foundation to create our forensic workstation, we need to downloads the software which will be needed for forensic purposes. Step N\u00b0 5 : Post-installation If you have successfully accomplished all the previous steps, then congralutations ! Enjoy your tuned workstation and don't forget to create a snapshot if it is a virtual machine. This will allow you to go back to a functionnal version of your VM in case you have broken it.
