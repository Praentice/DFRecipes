## Warning
IDA, despite being a good tool, have a lot of innaccuracies. please be careful. Especially when IDA put semantics values and name. 

## Shortcuts
`CTRL + E` : List entries point (useful to begin the reverse somewhere)
`CTRL + Y` : Get function prototype (Useful to see how a function is called and thus, to identify the usage of different registry and variables) (Think inversly, the last argument pushed on the stack will be the first used by the function call)
`ALT + T` : Display menu to search occurences of a string, value (Useful to search the occurence of an ID within the executable)
`Left click -> N` : Rename value
`Left click -> Q` : Change value representation to hexadecimal (Useful to check if an instruction is related to the stack)
`Left click -> T` : 
`Ctrl + A` define string as other
`U` : Undefine something
`Alt + Q` : Define type of variable based on the created structures
### Shortcut for windows
`Shift + F12` : Strings windows (Useful to search )
